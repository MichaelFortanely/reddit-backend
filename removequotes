Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down."

      "body": "I checked this one out about two weeks ago, before my winter break started. I read about eighty pages, and did not read any further over winter break, as I am not one who is consistent about my reading of novels. I started reading again on Monday… I found that I was really enjoying it, but I was growing to like it so much today by the time I reached about pg. 170 that I actually couldn’t stop reading. I am not an avid reader, yet I must admit that this novel is the kind that stays on one’s mind. It is VERY well written. I did not even necessarily “like” Winston, yet I found myself able to empathize with him, found myself thinking more about humanity, about psychology, about philosophy and morality, in spite of the fact that I am a senior in high school. The big reveal was shocking to me. I audibly said “oh my god” in class whilst reading it. I have struggled with feeling that I do not read books that challenge me - whilst “1984” wasn’t difficult to follow, I did find myself learning new terms, such as “totalitarian,” “oligarchy,” etc. I found myself feeling afraid, as whilst I know that this is oft-said, we could easily one day live in a 1984-like society, seeing as how in a sense the government already is watching us. I cannot get the words “Big Brother” off my mind. I wish that we had read this in AP English last year. I have found a greater number of books this year that I enjoy, but “1984” really sticks with you. It makes you question society, question authority, rules. I would love to read more novels like this one."
