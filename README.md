# reddit-backend

This repo is the back end repository for notReddit.

Built a simplifed clone of reddit using the MERN (MongoDB, Express,
React, and Node) stack. Upon logging in users can view, vote, comment
on, and create posts. The website can be navigated with the sidebar
and users can be brought to the page for specific posts by clicking on
the post or searching for it with the search bar.
